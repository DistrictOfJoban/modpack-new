# Joban Modpack (Packwiz)
This is the modpack for The District of Joban server, intended to superseded the [old Modpack workflow](https://github.com/DistrictOfJoban/Modpack).  

## Cycle
Mod list is updated every 4 hours (or on push), and will self-commit back to this repo where a github page is hosted.  
The `modpack.zip` is an empty MultiMC-compatible modpack format containing a packwiz-installer prelaunch command, which will execute an update check on all files to ensure that they are up to date.
